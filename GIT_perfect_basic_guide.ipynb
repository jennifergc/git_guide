    " Github is only one framework that uses git to manage online versions of your work. The main of this guide is to be able to use git locally (more convenient) via terminal and at the same time ensure a secure and easy cloud backup. So, before start using local git, before using the local git, let's do this synchronization:\n",

    "4) Using GIT and GITHUB with superpowers\n",
    "\n",
    "We need understand the mechanism/protocol of git: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Whit a git folder you'll start a TREE. Each tree has a BRANCH. The initial BRANCH state of the repo has the name MASTER. For do that we always type:\n",
    "  > git init\n",
    "- If you want to have very alternative versions of a proyect you should have other BRANCHES obviously at the same level of MASTER.\n",
    "- You need to tell git which branch you'll use. For starting in this world we'll ignore this posibility and for now will always work in the MASTER branch.\n",
    "- When you make changes to the repository you can identify a state of the work that maybe should be saved if something gets damaged later on. For make that, git stablish three levels of working:\n",
    "Level 1: **Working directory** (Unsaved data) \n",
    "Level 2: **Staging area** (Identified changes) typing:\n",
    "> git add\n",
    "\n",
    "You should add for the staging area an specific file like this:\n",
    "> git add <file>\n",
    "\n",
    "For everything:\n",
    "> git add -A\n",
    "\n",
    "Level 3: **Git repository** (Saved version of the folder) typing:\n",
    "> git commit -m \"commit message\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- The important thing about this step, is that you can create one (or many) new branches from a given commit, for that it sets a flag for each commit.\n",
    "- After committing your changes, the next thing you want to do is send your changes to the remote server.\n",
    "> git push -u origin <branch_name>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Before start working on the local repo, you always may update your repo from the local server. Like this:\n",
    "> git pull\n",
    "\n",
    "5) LIFE HACK FOR USE THE CLOUD - LOCAL SYNC\n",
    "\n",
    "Really I don't know how to made it different... so, MY WAY IS first create the repo on GITHUB and SYNC the repo in my LAPTOP\n",
    "(if you find another way, let me know). Follow the steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ok, go to Github, click on _repositories_ and click on _New_\n",
    "- Write a name (don't use spaces)\n",
    "- Write a description (optional)\n",
    "- Define the visibility for others\n",
    "- Add the README file (Ok all the repos should have this shit please)\n",
    "- Keep the other things unchanged\n",
    "- Click on _Create repository_\n",
    "- Copy the SSH link\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go to SYNC this on our local server:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Go to the terminal\n",
    "- Type on the local repo folder:\n",
    "  > git remote add origin [SSH link] \n",
    "- You must call the local repo the same as the remote repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "**WE DID IT!!!!!**\n",
    "Now you can use the basic comand lines for sync the local repo with GITHUB.\n",
    "\n",
    "**You're welcome**\n"
